# Number Guessing Game

A simple number guessing game built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Local Development

Just open `index.html` in your web browser. No build step or dependencies needed!

## Deployment to Vercel

1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)

2. Import your project in Vercel:
   - Go to https://vercel.com
   - Click "Add New Project"
   - Import your Git repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect it as a static site

3. Deploy! Vercel will serve your `index.html` file automatically.

Alternatively, you can use the Vercel CLI:
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

That's it! No build configuration needed - just a single HTML file.
